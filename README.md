# MineRobber's blog generator
Made with Python, love, care, and [markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2)!

##Configuration
Here's how to configure this blog generator:

1. Run `cp config-skel.py config.py` or your system's equivalent.  
2. Edit config.py to your liking. A lot of it is self-explanatory, but if you need help, [never fear, the wiki is here!](https://github.com/MineRobber9000/blog-gen/wiki/Configuration)
